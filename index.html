  			<h3 class="deck container center spaceAbove2rem">Well, Alex K. Fong to be exact. I am a thirtysomething Chinese-American visual journalist. I work at <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn">China Daily</a> as its assistant design director.</h3>

	  		</div>
	  		<h3 class="deck container center spaceAbove2rem">I was born in San Francisco, went to college in San Diego, landed my first real job in San Jose and bought a house in Berkeley, California in the United States. I currently live in Beijing, China.</h3>

  			<h3 class="deck container center spaceAbove2rem">What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  			<p class="container center spaceAbove2rem">I like reading and making music. I am currently the guitarist for a Beijing-based rock band called The Paper Tigers. Our influences include The Clash, Franz Ferdinand, The Cure, Bloc Party and The Police.</p>
  			<h3 class="deck container center spaceAbove2rem">What&rsquo;s your dream job?</h3>
  			<p class="container center spaceAbove2rem">I&rsquo;m in love with the creative process. I love making things. And that's really my dream job: continuing to make things that didn't exist before. Graphic design and web development are just means to that end.</p>
  			<h3 class="deck container center spaceAbove2rem">What have you been listening to?</h3>
			<p class="container center spaceAbove2rem">I've been listening to a mix of things. I somehow missed all of Ryan Adams&rsquo; records with the Cardinals, so I'm spinning those. I'm also listening a lot to the great jazz guitarist and educator Ted Greene, whose books I'm currently studying. His solo guitar playing is really tremendous, and the tones he gets out of his telecaster (which I also play) are quite inspiring.</p>
